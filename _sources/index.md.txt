# Overview

This project attempts to convert a given image to a CAD representation using a medial axis.
The motivation behind this is using results of topological optimization to generate a CAD model.

## Basic concepts

The documentation asserts the reader is familiar with the following concepts:

1. [**CAD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design): computer-aided design (CAD).
2. [**Medial axis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis): A set of points that are connected by straight lines.
3. [**Topological optimization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization): A process of minimizing the cost of a given model.
4. [**Voronoi diagram**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram): A partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects.
